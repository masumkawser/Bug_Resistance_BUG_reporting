Bug reporting is the process of documenting and communicating software defects to developers or relevant teams. A well-structured bug report helps in identifying, reproducing, and fixing issues efficiently.  

### **Key Components of a Bug Report**  
1. **Title** – A short, descriptive summary of the issue.  
2. **Description** – A clear explanation of what the bug is, including its impact.  
3. **Steps to Reproduce** – Detailed steps to help developers replicate the bug.  
4. **Expected Result** – What should happen if the software works correctly.  
5. **Actual Result** – What happens instead due to the bug.  
6. **Environment Details** – Information about the system, browser, OS, and software version.  
7. **Attachments (if applicable)** – Screenshots, screen recordings, or logs for better understanding.  
8. **Severity/Priority** – The impact level of the bug (Critical, High, Medium, Low).  
9. **Assigned To (if applicable)** – The person or team responsible for fixing the issue.
